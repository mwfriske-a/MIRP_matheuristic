## This is an example of specifying instances with a file.

# Each line is an instance relative to trainInstancesDir
# (see scenario.txt.tmpl) and an optional sequence of instance-specific
# parameters that will be passed to target-runnerx when invoked on that
# instance.

# Empty lines and comments are ignored.
