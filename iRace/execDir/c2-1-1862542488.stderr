../../build/mirp.out: invalid option -- '-'
usuage is 
 -v : Version (1 - for MILP; 2- for fix-and-relax vertically; 3-fix-and-relax horizontally) 
 -p : instance path 
 -t : time limit in seconds - for -v = 2, corresponds to timelimit of local searches 
 -s : A string to put together in the logFile name 
-q : 1 if use valid inequalities,0 otherwise 
-c : 1 if use additional constraints, 0 otherwise 
-d : 1 if use tightening of inventory contraints, 0 otherwise (only when e > 0) 
-k : 1 if use of proportional alphaMaxJ, 0 otherwise (only when e > 0) 
-z : 1 if simplify instance, 0 otherwise 
-b : 1 if bounds on flow fOB(fWB) and fX are tighten
For -v = {2,3} (Fix and relax algorithm):
 -n : Number of intervals in the first phase (-v =2) 
 -g : Initial GAP for solving the first phase (-v = 2,3) 
-f : Number of intervals that leaves the end block in each iteration (-v =2) 
 -o : percentage of overlapping between the fixed and the integer interval (-v =2) 
 -e : Size of the end block/vessels out of model (must be at most n-2) 
 -r : Vessels out of model (must be at most v-2) 
 -l : Time limit for solving each interval 
 -m : Number of intervals in the improvement phase (-v =2)
 -i : Time limit for one loop in the improvement phase 
 -h : Fixed GAP in the imnprovement phase 
 -u : Overlap in the imnprovement phase
